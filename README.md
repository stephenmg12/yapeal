# YAPEAL (Yet Another PHP Eve Api Library) #

Here's a [new link][6] to some additional docs I've started

***New README coming here soon!!!***

[Composer][1] is now the recommended way to install Yapeal. See [INSTALL.md][2] for help with installation.

For additional information about any changes see the commit messages in the
repository and the [CHANGELOG.md][3] file.

Licensing requirements can be found in [LICENSE.md][4] and
[GNU-GPL.md][5].

Thanks for using Yapeal, Dragonaire
